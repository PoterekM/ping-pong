# _Ping-Pong_

#### _Epicodus Intro to Programming: Arrays and Looping independent project, June 9, 2017_

#### By _**Michelle Poterek**_

## Description

_This project takes a user's input number and presents a range from 1 to the chosen number. The stipulations are that:_
* **Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "Ping!"**
* **Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "Pong!"**
* **Numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, or 15, are replaced with "Ping-Pong!"**


### Behavior Driven Development: _Making life less buggy one line at a time_
_Below is the Behavior Driven Development (BDD) created to write and test the Ping-Pong application. It starts out with a process that is fundamental to the program running appropriately and increases in complexity as the list goes on. This BDD tells the programmer:_

* _Where to start in the process_
* _What to test and what not to test_
* _How much to test in one go_
* _What to call the tests_
* _How to understand why a test fails_


_This chart chart lists the behaviors of the program with expected input and output from the program. Each parameter has to pass in order to develop the next segment of the program._

<!-- _{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_ -->
